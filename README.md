# RSA Encryption Demo

This is a simple Python application that demonstrates RSA encryption and decryption using the `rsa` library and a graphical user interface (GUI) created with the `tkinter` library.

## Overview

RSA encryption is a widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm that allows secure communication between parties by encrypting and decrypting messages using public and private keys. This application showcases how RSA encryption can be implemented in Python.

## Features

- Generate RSA key pair (public and private keys).
- Encrypt a user-entered message with the public key.
- Decrypt the encrypted message with the private key.

## Getting Started

1. Install the required ibrabries if you haven't already
   pip install rsa
2. Run the application
   python main.py

## Depencencies
- Python 3.x
- `rsa` library
- `tinker`library (usually included with python)
